TO-DO:
1. make a new column in the viz window of the rgb image or raw image
2. check for other research papers that cite this paper and see what they do or did they encounter this issue
3. try other configs 
4. try other things with the camera pose again

PROGRESS LOG:
1. tracking time step, keyframe number and tracking iteration have been reduced to avoid crashing when running splatam
2. reduce the number of images (depth and rgb) to avoid crashing when running splatam
2. depth images has been refined to get brighter depth image 
3. so far, the best result from the tracking iteration is using the dummy pose with replica/iphone config(i forgot)
4. using the poses only gets dark result
5. using ICP refined poses with iphone config results in better result than the poses only. but still dark at the center

when running current splatam, at time step 28 out of 30, error:
